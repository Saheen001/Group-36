\subsection{Building a C program for a calculator in the local
repository,committing,and publishing it as a public repository}
\section{Introduction}
This document outlines the process of creating a basic calculator in C, committing it to a local Git repository, and pushing it to a public repository on GitHub.
\section{Step 1: Writing the C Program}
Below is the source code for a simple calculator written in C:
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{c calculator.png} % Adjusted width
     \hspace{4 cm}
    \caption{Screenshot of the source code.}
\end{figure}
\section{Step 2: Create a New Repository on GitHub}

1. Go to your GitHub profile: \href{https://github.com/SOMENSARDAR2002}{GitHub - https://github.com/SOMENSARDAR2002}.
2. Click on \texttt{New} to create a new repository.
3. Name the repository \texttt{C-Calculator} and ensure it is set to \texttt{Public}.
4. Do not initialize the repository with a \texttt{README}, \texttt{.gitignore}, or license, as these are not needed for the local repository you have created.

\section{Step 3: Push Local Repository to GitHub}

Copy the remote URL of the new GitHub repository. It should look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Example remote URL}]
https://github.com/ABIR462/C-Calculator.git
\end{lstlisting}

Add the remote repository to your local Git:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption={Adding a remote repository}]
git remote add origin https://github.com/ABIR462/C-Calculator.git
\end{lstlisting}

Push your local commits to the GitHub repository:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption={Pushing to GitHub}]
git push -u origin master
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Step 4: Verify on GitHub}

Visit your GitHub profile to ensure that the code is now available in your public repository: \hrefhttps:{//github.com/SOMENSARDAR2002}{https://github.com/SOMENSARDAR2002}.

\paragraph{}
\vspace{0.5cm}
Steps to Fix the Button and Create a Pull Request\\

1. Clone the Repository:
   - You’ve already cloned the repository using GitHub Desktop, so you should have the project on your local machine.\\
\vspace{1cm}

2. Open the Project:
   - Open the project in your preferred IDE as per the instructions in the readme.md.\\
\vspace{1cm}

3. Locate the Button Code:
   - Search for the code where the submit button is defined. This is typically found in the frontend code of the application. Depending on the technology stack used (e.g., HTML/CSS, React, Angular, etc.), it could be in a file like index.html, App.js, ButtonComponent.js, or a similar file.\\
\vspace{1cm}

4. Rename the Button:
   - You renamed the button to "Chin Tapak Dum Dum". If the button’s size became disproportionate, it’s likely due to styling issues.\\
\vspace{1cm}

5. Test the Application:
   - Run the application again to ensure that the button appears correctly and that there are no additional issues.\\
\vspace{1cm}

6. Commit Your Changes:
   - Once the button looks good, commit your changes. Use descriptive commit messages, for example: Fixed button styling after renaming.

   bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fixed button styling after renaming to 'Chin Tapak Dum Dum'"
   \\
\vspace{1cm}
   
7. Push Your Changes:
   - Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

   bash
   git push origin main
   

   (Replace main with the correct branch name if it's different.)\\
\vspace{1cm}
   
8. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to the original repository on GitHub (the one you cloned from).
   - You should see an option to create a pull request from your forked repository. Follow the instructions to create a pull request with a title and description of what you have done.

   Make sure to mention in the pull request that you have fixed the button styling after renaming it.
